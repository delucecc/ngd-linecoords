**ngd-linecoords** is a simple developer tool that uses drawline and raycasting.  This allows you to get the coords of a collision and then copy them to your clipboard with a command.

This is useful for setting props, zones, peds, whatever else that you don't want to have to try and noclip in and out of to get the correct location.
